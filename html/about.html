            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Since coming to New York, my friends and I have visited Westside Market, a market nearby school, 
                to go buy snacks and drinks. After noticing that the grocery store has its own juice brand, 
                me and my friends had made it our goal to try each flavor. Over the course of the past year, we have tried and 
                rated every flavor of juice that the grocery store sells, and have been rating them in the notes app. 
                This website is a clean version of all of our ratings.</p>
